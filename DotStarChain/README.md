# DotStar Chain

//...Work in progress... Working on 3D rendering. Most likely will be in a "snowflake" pattern (not super stoked about that but that's what it kinda looks like.) Connect multiple single links together for a longer chain to wrap around the tree. Each link will be an 8 point star pattern that operates opn the same opposing-directions daisy-chained strip like the DotStar Ball (except that multiple links will be addressed by a single uController.)
